//  Workopia - Job Listing Management Application
/ Overview
Workopia is a comprehensive job listing management system developed as a capstone project for the "PHP From Scratch 2024: Beginner to Advanced" course by Brad Traversy on Udemy. This project encapsulates the entirety of the course content, applying advanced PHP techniques, MySQL integration, object-oriented programming, and web security measures to create a fully functional web application.

/ Features
User Authentication and Authorization: Secure signup and login processes with differentiated access levels based on user roles.
Job Listings Management: Users can add, view, update, and delete job listings. This feature demonstrates handling forms in PHP and interacting with a MySQL database.
Admin Dashboard: A dedicated backend interface for administrators to manage listings, user accounts, and system settings.
API Integration: Incorporation of external APIs to extend functionality, such as email services.
Responsive Design: Utilizes HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to ensure that the application is accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
Security Implementations: Emphasizes securing the application against common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).
MVC Architecture: The application is built using a simple MVC framework developed during the course, which helps organize code and separate business logic from the UI.
Educational Purpose
Workopia serves as a practical implementation to solidify the theoretical knowledge provided in the course. It offers students a real-world application context, enhancing their understanding of how different components interact within a web application. The project is not only a great tool for learning PHP and web development but also an excellent addition to a developer's portfolio to showcase their skills.
